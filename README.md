# python-challenge

In this two part challenge, I was asked to use python to read through a csv, calculate certain values, and print those values in the code as well as to a txt file. 

The first part of the challenge is called PyBank and my code can be found in the 'analysis' folder within the 'PyBank' folder. In PyBank, I found:

  + The total number of months included in the dataset
  + The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  + The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  + The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  + The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

And I printed that information in my code as well as wrote to a txt file, which is in the PyBank folder.

The second part of the challenge is called PyPoll and my code can be found in the 'analysis' folder within the 'PyPol' folder. In PyPoll, I found:

  + The total number of votes cast
  + A complete list of candidates who received votes
  + The percentage of votes each candidate won
  + The total number of votes each candidate won
  + The winner of the election based on popular vote

And I printed that information in my code as well as wrote to a txt fil, which is in the PyPoll folder.
